# ECON 691: Understanding Codespaces using GitHub's "Haikus for Codespaces"

This is a quick node project template for demoing Codespaces. It is based on the [Azure node sample](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/nodejs-docs-hello-world). We will be using this as an assignment to familiarize you with GitHub Codespaces and how to do "commits" in them. As a bonus, it will also introduce you to "ports" and preview the ability to change webpages with code.

## Assignment Instructions

This assignment is a modification of [Quickstart for GitHub Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/getting-started/quickstart), which provides a tour of using Codespaces with this repo.

1. Please open [Quickstart for GitHub Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/getting-started/quickstart) in a separate tab from this README set of instructions.
2. Read the "Introduction" section.
3. Do not follow the instructions in the "Creating your codespace" section. Instead, you will do the following:  
    a. Leaving both this README and the Quickstart doc open in their tabs, open your assignment repo in a third tab.  
    b. Click the green "Code" button and open the Codespace that is already assigned to you by GitHub classroom.
4.  Then, continue to follow the instructions in the Quickstart document for the remaining sections. Since this isn't a test of your creativity, in the "Edit the application" section, for the instruction "Edit the text field of the first haiku to personalize the application with your own haiku," I would like you to simply **change the city** in the first poem.
5.  In the "Committing and pushing your changes" section, after you "commit" the next option will be to "Synch your changes." (You will not see a "publish new branch" option when you are using your assignment repo.)
